Solution:
-Go to etherscan, search the Level instance.  Click on "Contract Creation" in 
the internal transactions tab. This address is the lost contract.  Call "recovery"
with this address and your player address.

Other Notes:
-Method 2, not using etherscan, involves doing keccak256(address, nonce):
hashing the transaction creator with in this case 0 since it's that creators
first transaction, will get you the address of the contract created.
