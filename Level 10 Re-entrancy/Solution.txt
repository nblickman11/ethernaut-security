Solution:
-See balance of Level contract with: await getBalance(contract.address)
-call Hack's myDonate() with .001 Eth.  Creates balance of hack contract in level.
-call initialWithdraw(.001), which calls Level's withdraw(), which sends to 
Hack's fallback, which recalls withdraw().
-call withdrawToMe() to send Eth from contract to player.

Other Notes:
-syntax for .call, passing Eth value AND specifying function to call:
        (bool success, ) = reentrance.call{value: msg.value}(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("donate(address)", address(this))
        );
