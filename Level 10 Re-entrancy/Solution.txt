Solution:
-Call hack() with the Level address and .001 Eth (enough to become king).
-After submission, the level will try and fail to become king, because
payable(king).transfer(msg.value) will call our contract and fail because
our contract doesn't have a payable fallback.

Other Notes:
-low level function ".call" allows you to call contract using the address,
and don't need the contract instance.  Also not specifying a function here
so calls the fallback receive()
-receive() can only receive ether (unlike fallback())
