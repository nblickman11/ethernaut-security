Solution:
Call hack() in our Hack.


OTHER NOTES:
*we can't change our state and modify our own isSold variable, so we use
shopInst.isSold(); to get the value instead.
*side note: my buy() function in my interface was incorrectly stating returns(uint). This led to an infinite loop since the actual buy function
doesn't return anything but my interface was stating it would.  So it must've stayed their infinitely using up gas.
*side note: if func 1 calls func 2 which modifies state, func 1 can't be 
"view" either
