Solution:
Check your starting token balance:
await contract.balanceOf(player).then(x=>x.toString())
Call ERC-20's approve function on this amount:
const valueInWei = toWei("1000000", "ether");
await contract.approve(player, valueInWei)
Call ERC-20's transferFrom function on this amount:
await contract.transferFrom(player, any_random_address, valueInWei)

Other Notes:
-the ERC 20 transfer function, which inherits from the parent, was being restricted
with a modifier.  Had to use ERC-20's transferFrom().
