Solution:
call hack().  masks tx.origin for correct key.  for loop tries different gas amounts till correct.

Other Notes:
-calling an abi function, which fails it's require statement, will always revert
the entire transaction.  However, using .call() instead of abi, you can check if 
the call fails the require, and still continue to the transaction.
-unlike bytes(), uint() conversions keep the LAST(RIGHT) bytes.
-f's keep bytes as is, and 0 makes them 0:
bytes8 key = bytes8(uint64(tx.origin)) & 0xffffffff0000ffff;
