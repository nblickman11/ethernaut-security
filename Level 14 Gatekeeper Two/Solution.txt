Solution:
Just deploy the Hack contract!

Other Notes:
-this is inline assembly code which checks the size of the calling contract:
    assembly { x := extcodesize(caller()) }
-we put our contract code in the constructor so it's part of code initialization
and the contract is still seen as empty.
-a XOR b = c means (a XOR C = b). XOR is exclusive or.
-abi.encodePacked's result is a byte array without padding.
-keccak256's result is a encrypted 32 byte output
